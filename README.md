  Game title: Eat The Apple
    “[EAT THE APPLE] is an action maze chase game inspired by Pac-Man. (Player) controls a deer in a field.” 

  -  Platform:
     This game is designed for Windows 10 and above. 

  -  Gameplay:
     Objective:
     “The goal of the game is for the deer to eat all the apples placed in the field while avoiding the four farmers. When each farmer approaches the deer on his own path, he starts chasing it. The game ends when      the farmer catches the deer. The player wins when he eats all the apples. The name of the best player and the score he got are saved.”

 -  Controls:
     Arrow Keys: Move the player to left right up and down.

 - Features
   - Using AI for implementing the enemies' movements 
   - Save and load the best player’s score

 - Development information:
     Engine:
    “This game was developed in Unity using C# for scripting.”

 - Contributions:
   I handled all programming, and UI design.

 - Issues: 
   The enemies still have some bugs in chasing the player and that’s when they hit a wall and can’t move toward the next reserved position.   

 - Challenges:
   - Implementing Save and Load: Understanding what data to save and when to load it posed significant challenges.
   - Persistence Data: Transferring persistent data from one scene to another took considerable time and effort to implement.
   - Enemy Pathfinding and Behavior: Initially, programming enemies to follow a specific path and chase the player seemed straightforward, but it proved to be quite challenging.
   
 - Effort:
   - Research and Learning: Utilized Unity Learn to study various topics related to data persistence, which was crucial for addressing the challenges.
   - Algorithm Development: Researched extensively, noting that in Pacman, each ghost has a unique algorithm for movement and chasing.
   - AI Feature Implementation: Discovered Unity’s AI feature, which was beneficial for my game, and implemented it after watching numerous YouTube tutorials.
   - Time Management: Despite the limited time to complete the game, I diligently worked through tutorials and documentation to successfully integrate the features.
